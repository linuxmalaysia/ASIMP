# ASIMP Agent & Google Jules Guidelines & Instructions

Welcome, **Google Jules** and other AI/LLM agents! This document outlines coding conventions, architecture constraints, and testing protocols specifically for automated development tools working on **ASIMP (Ansible System Integrity Management Platform)**.

Use this as your single source of truth for repository structure, styling standards, and operational guidelines.

## 🧭 Project Purpose & Core Architecture

ASIMP is an automated security baseline and hardening framework. Its primary mission is to:
1. Conduct initial host compliance checks (OpenSCAP/Lynis) to establish a baseline.
2. Apply systems-level hardening configurations (SSH, kernels, updates).
3. Re-run compliance audits to verify and print the exact security delta.

It follows a strict **"Measure, Harden, Re-Measure"** workflow.

## 📁 Repository Structure

- **`play.yml`**: Main playbook designed for multi-host remote configurations.
- **`play-localhost.yml`**: Main playbook tailored for executing ASIMP on the localhost environment.
- **`requirements.yml`**: External Ansible Galaxy dependencies (SSH, chrony, etc.).
- **`requirements.txt`**: Python dependencies (Ansible, ansible-lint, cryptography).
- **`ansible.cfg`**: Configures Ansible behaviors, SSH pipelining, and custom roles paths.
- **`roles/`**:
  - `reporting-ASIMP`: Manages the dual-engine baseline generation, post-hardening analysis, and reporting.
  - `update-ubuntu-ASIMP`: Handles Ubuntu/Debian system upgrades, repository updates, and `debsums` verification.
  - `lynis-ansible`: Manages localized Lynis audit automation and compliance profiling.
